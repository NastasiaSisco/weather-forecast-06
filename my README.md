# Weather Forecast and Dashboard

First attempt at server-side API fetching. Interesting to see how to use keys and "walk the DOM". Assignment from Bootcamp!

## Visuals

Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation

Check it out on Pages

## Usage

Type in a city name to see some interesting data points. Click on saved searches to refresh/revisit them.

## Roadmap

Probably need to check on those fahrenheit readings..

## Authors and acknowledgment

Shout out to the 2 dozen repos I referenced for inspo and openweathermap.org documentation
